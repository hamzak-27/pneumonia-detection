# pneumonia-detection

This repository contains a deep learning model developed for early pneumonia diagnosis using chest X-ray images. Leveraging TensorFlow and transfer learning techniques, this project aims to enhance medical diagnostics by providing an efficient and accurate tool for detecting pneumonia at an early stage.

Features
- TensorFlow Integration: Utilizes TensorFlow for model development, training, and evaluation.
- Transfer Learning: Employs a pre-trained CNN model, fine-tuned for pneumonia detection, improving accuracy and reducing training time.
- LIME Explainability: Integrates LIME to provide interpretable visual explanations for model predictions, aiding in the understanding and      trust of the diagnostic tool.
- Efficient and Accurate: Designed to be both time-efficient and accurate, making it a practical tool for early pneumonia diagnosis.
